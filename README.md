This repo contains more code samples Ive created

/automobiles/ - a short object-oriented demo 

/counties/ - my solving of the TPS problem. It works but runs out of memory 
after the array is bigger than 10 coords or so.

/employees/ - a file that searches employees in the SQL database, and can search by name.
